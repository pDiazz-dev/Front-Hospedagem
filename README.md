## 💡 About the Project

This repository contains the **frontend** of the Hosting Management System.

The interface was built using **pure web technologies**, focusing on simplicity, usability, and integration with a backend API.

The frontend communicates with a **Spring Boot backend**, which is responsible for business logic and database persistence.

---

## 🔗 Backend Integration

The backend for this project is available at:

👉 **Backend Repository:**  
https://github.com/Theus28238/SistemaDeHospedagem

To run the full system locally, the frontend files must be placed inside the backend project at:
```
src/main/resources/static
```
---

This allows Spring Boot to serve the frontend directly.
